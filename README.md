I am very fascinated by analytics. It's always telling a story, whether its the top selling items of the year, or the most popular brands among millennials. 

One way or another, all companies are using analytics to make all their processes more efficient, allowing them to maximize value. 

In all my projects, I try to hone my technical skills (Microsoft Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau) to help illustrate the numbers.

I am intrinsically motivated, always pushing myself to achieve success. Over the last few years, I completed more than a dozen online courses. Besides, I helped one company secure a lucrative deal with a large property management company, and helped another company increase sales by nearly 50% over a two year span. 

Please feel free to reach out if you would like to inquire about this further.
